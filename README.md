# 🌐 API Documentation Portfolio

### _Designing clear, secure, and high-performance interface references._

## 📌 Philosophy

API documentation is a contract between the provider and the consumer. I approach API docs with a **"Test-First" mindset**, ensuring that every endpoint, header, and response code is verified before it is published. My focus is on:

*   **Predictable Error Handling:** Clear descriptions of status codes to reduce developer frustration.
    
*   **Schema Accuracy:** Ensuring JSON/XML payloads match the live production environment.
    
*   **Authentication Clarity:** Making API Key, OAuth2, and JWT implementations foolproof.

## 🛠 API Talent Stack

I treat documentation as a living part of the development lifecycle:

*   **Specifications:** OpenAPI (OAS 3.0), Swagger, RAML.
    
*   **Testing & Tooling:** Postman Collections, cURL, Insomnia.
    
*   **Environments:** Markdown-based static site generators (Docusaurus, Redocly).
